            <a id="about me"></a>
                <p>
                  Hello! Thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio. My 
                  name is Katlynn Blanton and I am currently a Program Manager for 
                  Technical Projects for Amazon Corporate. My journey into the field 
                  of technology was non-traditional to start. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have had a love for STEM fields my entire life and found myself 
                  immersed in Mathmatics. I graduated from the University of Cincinnati
                  in August of 2020 with my BBA in Accounting. I now find myself owning 
                  the launch of new technology to over twelve teams within Amazon. This 
                  sparked my interest in expanding my skills and diving into the world of 
                  coding and development!
                </p>
